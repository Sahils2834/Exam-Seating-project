📘 Exam Seating Arrangement System

A Full-Stack Web Application




📌 Project Overview

The Exam Seating Arrangement System is a full-stack web application designed to digitally manage exams, users, seating plans, and seating visibility for students, teachers, and administrators.

It eliminates manual seating allocation and allows:

Admins to manage exams & permissions

Teachers to upload seating CSV files

Students to securely view their seating arrangement

The project follows role-based access control, ensuring each user only sees what they are allowed to.

🔐 Authentication & Security

JWT-based authentication

Tokens stored in localStorage

Automatic logout on token expiry

Role-based route protection using ProtectedRoute

Backend role guards using middleware




📊 Seating Arrangement Flow (Important)

Teacher uploads seating CSV for an exam

File is stored in:

Database (uploads collection)

File system (/backend/uploads)

Students click “View Seating”

CSV is:

Read from backend

Parsed using PapaParse

Displayed as a table on the frontend




⚠️ No seating grid logic is used for students — CSV is shown directly as requested.

▶️ How to Run the Project (IMPORTANT)
✅ Step 1: Open two terminals
Terminal 1 → Backend
Terminal 2 → Frontend
▶️ Backend Setup
cd backend
npm install


Create a .env file:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
ADMIN_PASS=admin123

▶️ Run Backend
node server.js


Backend will start at:

http://localhost:5000

▶️ Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install

▶️ Run Frontend
npm start


Frontend will start at:

http://localhost:3000

🔄 API Communication

Frontend → Backend via Axios

Base URL:

http://localhost:5000/api


JWT token automatically attached using Axios interceptors

Unauthorized access redirects user to login




📄 CSV Format (Seating Upload)

Example CSV structure:

rollNumber,seat,row,col
CS101,R1-C1,1,1
CS102,R1-C2,1,2


Other column names are also supported as long as rollNumber exists.





🧪 Error Handling & Logs

Backend returns proper HTTP status codes

Frontend shows fallback messages:

“No seating uploaded yet”

“Loading seating arrangement…”

Console logs added for debugging (can be removed for production)
